## 🌟 Overview

A modern, responsive portfolio website showcasing my work as a designer and developer. Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks), this single-page application showcases creative work with elegant animations and interactive elements such as smooth animations, a custom cursor, and dark/light mode toggle.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Custom Cursor Effects**: Interactive dual-cursor system with hover states
- **Smooth Animations**: Scroll-triggered fade-in effects with staggered delays
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between dark/light themes with persistent preference
- **Project Filtering**: Category-based portfolio filtering system
- **Project Modals**: Detailed project view with image galleries
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-friendly with hamburger menu
- **Contact Form**: Functional form with validation and toast notifications
- **Skills Visualization**: Animated skill bars that trigger on scroll

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Pure CSS Animations**: No animation libraries - all custom CSS transitions
- **Modern CSS**: CSS variables for theming, grid/flexbox layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No jQuery or frameworks - optimized performance
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios, keyboard navigation
- **Optimized Assets**: Responsive images with lazy loading
- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-based animations
